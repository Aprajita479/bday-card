# Happy Birthday Card

This project is a simple HTML and CSS implementation of a Happy Birthday card. It displays a birthday-themed card with an image, text, and animation effects.

## Getting Started

To view the birthday card, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Prerequisites

No additional software or dependencies are required to run this project. A modern web browser is sufficient.

## Usage

Once the card is displayed in the browser, you can hover over the outer cover to reveal the inner cover, which flips with an animation effect. The card contains a title, a message, and a birthday image.

## Customization

If you want to customize the card or add your own content, you can modify the `index.html` file and the `style.css` file. You can replace the images by updating the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tags in the HTML file. Additionally, you can adjust the styles and layout by modifying the CSS rules in the `style.css` file.
